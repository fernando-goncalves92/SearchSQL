What is the SearchSQL?
=====================
SearchSQL is an open source .net core 3.0 winforms application.

The objective of this tool is to assist developers in tasks involving databases. Forget about your saved T-SQL scripts, which we hardly find when we need them. With this application you can search for objects and contents in your SQL Server database with just a few clicks. Add as many connections as you want and switch between them easily.

Give a Star! ‚≠ê
=====================
If you liked the project or if SearchSQL helped you, please give a star.

Note
=====================
For now this application only works with SQL Server database, however, feel free to fork this repository and implement your favorite DBMS.

Take a look at the Wiki page for instructions on how to use SearchSQL. üòâ
