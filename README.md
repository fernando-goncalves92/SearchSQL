# SearchSQL
SearchSQL is an open source .net core 3.0 winforms application.

The main objective of this tool is to assist developers in tasks involving databases. 

Forget about your saved T-SQL scripts, which we hardly find when we need them. With this application you can search for objects and contents directly in your SQL Server database with just a few clicks, add as many connections as you want and switch between them easily.

Note: For now this application only works with SQL Server database, however, feel free to fork this repository and implement your favorite DBMS.
